# Write a program that allows a user to play a guessing number game. 
# Your program should generate a random number between 0 â€“ 1000 (including 0, but not including 1000). 
# Allow the user to make a guess until they guess the answer. 
# After each guess you should print "higher" or "lower". 
# When they guess it correctly print a winning message along with their total number of guesses.
